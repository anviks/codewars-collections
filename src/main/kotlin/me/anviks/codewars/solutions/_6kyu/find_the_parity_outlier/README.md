<p>You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer <code>N</code>. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" <code>N</code>.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<pre><code>[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36] --&gt;  11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21] --&gt; 160 (the only even number)
</code></pre>
