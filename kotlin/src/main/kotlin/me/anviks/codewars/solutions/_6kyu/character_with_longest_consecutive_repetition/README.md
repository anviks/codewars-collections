# [Character with longest consecutive repetition](https://www.codewars.com/kata/586d6cefbcc21eed7a001155)

For a given string `s` find the character `c` (or `C`) with longest consecutive repetition and return:





```python
(c, l)
```




















where `l` (or `L`) is the length of the repetition. If there are two or more characters with the same `l` return the first in order of appearance.

For empty string return:





```python
('', 0)
```




















Happy coding! :)
