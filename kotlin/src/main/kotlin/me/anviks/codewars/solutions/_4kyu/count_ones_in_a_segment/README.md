# [Count ones in a segment](https://www.codewars.com/kata/596d34df24a04ee1e3000a25)

Given two numbers: 'left' and 'right' (1 <= 'left' <= 'right' <= 200000000000000)
return sum of all '1' occurencies in binary representations of numbers between 'left' and 'right' (including both)


WARNING: Segment may contain billion elements, to pass this kata, your solution cannot iterate through all numbers in the segment!
