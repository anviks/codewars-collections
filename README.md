[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is an online educational platform for computer programming.
On the platform, users known as *code warriors* attempt to solve programming challenges, known as
*kata*, to practice programming skills and earn honor points. Each kata is assigned a *kyÅ«* rank
based on its subject and difficulty (8 kyÅ« being the easiest and 1 kyÅ« being the most difficult).
The more difficult the kata, the more points will be awarded.
All code warriors start at a rank of 8 kyÅ« and advance through the ranks to the final 2 dan.

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions, translations and forks of katas I have completed on Codewars.
grouped by language and difficulty level. Each kata is stored in a separate folder, named after the
kata's slug. Inside each folder, you will find the following files:

- `README.md` - a description of the kata, including the problem statement, examples, and notes.
- `solution_{slug}.{ext}`/`{solution_class}.{ext}` - a file containing my solution to the kata.
- `test_{slug}.{ext}`/`{test_class}.{ext}` - a file containing the test cases for the kata.

Generally, I don't include solutions, that are easier than 6 kyu, because most of
them are simple enough, that even copying them here takes more time,
than just solving them in the codewars editor.
