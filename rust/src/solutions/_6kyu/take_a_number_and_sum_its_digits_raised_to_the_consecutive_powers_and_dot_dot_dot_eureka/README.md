# [Take a Number And Sum  Its Digits Raised To The Consecutive Powers And ....Â¡Eureka!!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5626b561280a42ecc50000d1)

The number 1, 10  --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
1, 100 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 89]
```

If there are no numbers of this kind in the range `$[a, b]$` the function should output an empty list.
```
90, 100 --> []
```
Enjoy it!!
