<p>How can you tell an extrovert from an introvert at NSA?<br>Va gur ryringbef, gur rkgebireg ybbxf ng gur BGURE thl'f fubrf.</p>
<p>I found this joke on USENET, but the punchline is scrambled. Maybe you can decipher it?<br>According to Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">ROT13</a> is frequently used to obfuscate jokes on USENET.</p>
<p>For this task you're only supposed to substitute characters. Not spaces, punctuation, numbers, etc.</p>
<p>Test examples:</p>
<pre><code>"EBG13 rknzcyr." -&gt; "ROT13 example."

"This is my first ROT13 excercise!" -&gt; "Guvf vf zl svefg EBG13 rkprepvfr!"
</code></pre>
