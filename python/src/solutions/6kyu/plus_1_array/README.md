# [+1 Array](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5514e5b77e6b2f38e0000ca9)

Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has 1 added to the value represented by the array.

- the array can't be empty
- only non-negative, single digit integers are allowed

Return `nil` (or your language's equivalent) for invalid inputs.

### Examples

**Valid arrays**

`[4, 3, 2, 5]` would return `[4, 3, 2, 6]`  
`[1, 2, 3, 9]` would return `[1, 2, 4, 0]`  
`[9, 9, 9, 9]` would return `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`  
`[0, 1, 3, 7]` would return `[0, 1, 3, 8]`

**Invalid arrays**

`[1, -9]` is invalid because `-9` is **not a non-negative integer**

`[1, 2, 33]` is invalid because `33` is **not a single-digit integer**
