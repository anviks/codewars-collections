Greed is a dice game played with five six-sided dice. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to score a throw according to these rules. You will always be given an array with five six-sided dice values.

A single die can only be counted once in each roll. For example, a given "5" can only count as part of a 
triplet (contributing to the 500 points) or as a single 50 points, but not both in the same roll.

Example scoring

```
 Throw       Score
 ---------   ------------------
 5 1 3 4 1   250:  50 (for the 5) + 2 * 100 (for the 1s)
 1 1 1 3 1   1100: 1000 (for three 1s) + 100 (for the other 1)
 2 4 4 5 4   450:  400 (for three 4s) + 50 (for the 5)
```

Note: your solution must not modify the input list.
