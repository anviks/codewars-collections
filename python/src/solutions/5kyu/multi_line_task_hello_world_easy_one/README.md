You are provided with the following functions:

```python
t = type
k = lambda x: lambda _: x
```

Write a function `f` that returns the string `Hello, world!`.

The rules are:

* The solution should not exceed 33 lines
* Every line should have at most 2 characters

Note: There is the same [kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5935558a32fb828aad001213) for this task on JS, but way harder than Python one, so it is the best option to create a separated kata with fair rank.
