<p>Write a method (or function, depending on the language) that converts a string to camelCase, that is, all words must have their first letter capitalized and spaces must be removed.</p>
<h4 id="examples-input----output">Examples (input --&gt; output):</h4>
<pre><code>"hello case" --&gt; "HelloCase"
"camel case word" --&gt; "CamelCaseWord"
</code></pre>
